Baikal Caldav Server
====================

What is this?
-------------

Baikal is a PHP application for a multi-user/multi-calendar caldav server.
This repo hosts a Vagrant setup that will allow you to spin up a new Baikal
caldav server in a jiffy.


OK, Vagrant has built the box. What next?
-----------------------------------------

Go to the URL (or IP address of the box), and follow the instructions to
install Baikal.

Once it's running, you will be able to access calendars on the URL:
*http://example.com/cal.php/principals/foo* where *example.com* is the URL/IP
address of the server, and *foo* is the username of a user that you've added.
